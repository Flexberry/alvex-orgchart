Alvex orgchart component
========================

Orgchart is an Alvex specific extension. It extends standard Alfresco user groups functionality by adding complete organizational chart to Alfresco that is sometimes more convenient for business users than flat groups.


Build
-----

The component may be packaged in two ways: *amp* and *jar*.
To build amp use `mvn clean package`, to build installable jar use `mvn -P make-jar clean package`.

**Note**: this project requires Maven 3.3.9 at least.
